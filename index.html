                        <h2>2.1. Digital participation and engagement</h2><br>
                        <p class="display-12">In general, social media engagement is the <b>measurement of people’s reactions in the digital world</b> (e.g. comments, likes and shares) that also help assess social media success. <b>Digital participation</b> and <b>engagement</b> have become essential elements of every entity (public or private) that is active on social platforms and seeks to form relationships with new and potential future customers or to create a public interest for its product.

</p><p><b>Digital participation</b> offers benefits and opportunities simplifying the methods and promoting familiarisation with the potential audience that we want to engage within our cultural activities. Examples of digital tools could be a museum’s account on social media, a library’s digital platform or account on social networks etc.</p>

<p>The questions of <b>“what to offer”</b> and <b>“how to present it”</b> are universal for all kinds of users. The same applies for GLAMs.</p>

<p>According to McLachlan (2020), some of the techniques that measure engagement are the following:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Shares or retweets</li>
                            <li>Likes</li>
                            <li>Followers and audience growth</li>
                            <li>Mentions (either tagged or untagged)</li>
                            <li>Using branded hashtags</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Cultural institutions encourage their visitors to post comments and pictures on social media as proof of cultural engagement or to collect memories of the visit. Taking and posting images on social networks is already a <b>trend</b> in the GLAMs sector social media activities. Accordingly, many museums’ actions are articulated around the <b> of an image or a post</b>. Similarly, many cultural institutions begin to <b>use hashtags</b> in their social accounts, posts and stories. A multitude of them now request from their followers to make a post with a hashtag on Twitter and Instagram (we will examine them in detail below)! These <b>initiatives can act as hubs</b> for people of various cultural backgrounds to come together and learn from each other’s experiences with a particular exhibition or museum.</p>

<p>Another example of cultural activities are those that imply the creation of objects by the audience. These initiatives aim at spreading knowledge on the issue and consequently, strengthening public engagement. Similarly, the theory of Constructionism, known as <b>“learning- by- making”</b>, proposed by Harel and Papert in 1991 deals with the idea of <b>generating understanding</b> and <b>knowledge</b> by producing things to be shared with others. Therefore, combining the “learning- by- making” theory with the use of social media, can increase the value of engagement built between our institution and our audiences.</p>

                       <p>According to Flowers (2018), <b>digital engagement</b> is more than your online presence, more than your social media and more than your memes. He gives another notion to this practice and perceives it not just as a lifeless tool. <b>Digital engagement is a process</b>, and as such it necessitates time and commitment by both parties interacting with each other. Undoubtedly, social media has already become part of this interactive relationship.</p>

                        <p>Finally, the use of social media platforms is already universal and statistics now inform us about how <b>young people </b>from different socio-demographic backgrounds <b>engage differently</b> with digital media. <b>The use of social media by GLAMs offers all young people the opportunity to access meaningful art and cultural life</b> which will consequently impact learning, creativity, and the fostering of civic engagement in cultural organisations. </p>

                        <h2>2.2. Social media</h2>
                        <p class="display-7">Let’s have a look now at the most popular social media platforms and what <b>added value</b> they can bring to a cultural institution. Social media presented here, have been selected as the most popular and widely used, especially among young people. Similarly, as social media like <b>Youtube</b>, <b>Facebook</b>, <b>Twitter</b> and <b>TikTok</b> are probably the most effective means of communication and contact with young people, several cultural institutions have based the promotion of campaigns, exhibitions and the creation of a community of followers on these social media, particularly during the COVID-19 crisis. In this context, the Zourou K., & Pellegrini E. study (<a href="https://glamers.eu/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/The-GLAMers-Study.pdf">2021</a>), carried out within the framework of The GLAMers project, investigated actions undertaken by GLAMs in which social media were used either as channels for promoting cultural activities or as means of transmitting knowledge and expanding their audience.</p> 

<h5><b>YOUTUBE</b></h5>

<p>In quantitative terms, YouTube comes third after Snapchat and Instagram as the most popular digital platforms, according to the Young People’s Cultural Journeys Report (<a href="https://www.artsconnect.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Arts-Connect-CCJ-report-FINAL.pdf">Arts Connect, June 2018</a>). YouTube allows users to create <b>effective videos of lectures</b> with minimal video equipment, thus reaching an important audience of young people. Besides, YouTube is highly optimised for mobile devices and the majority of students already know how to access the platform, making it an even more <b>familiar digital</b> space within which to interact with other people.</p>

<p>Consequently, YouTube has become a widely used digital platform that GLAMs should embrace as an effective means to <b>ncrease their audience reach as well as inclusively share their events and actions.</b>i</p>

<h5><b>FACEBOOK</b></h5>

Facebook is considered a popular digital and communication platform that allows GLAMs to interact with their audience. Other than being a digital tool for advertising and communicating actions, news and information with people, Facebook offers additional opportunities to reach even the most marginalised social groups. Specifically, thanks to Facebook Live, <b>museums can bring together art with people who can’t access museums in times of pandemics</b>, and also make collections more accessible to Deaf Art lovers.

                        <h5><b>NSTAGRAM</b><h5></h5>

<p>Instagram may combine quick and friendly follower engagement, but this doesn’t automatically translate into the formation of a deep engagement between followers and the content shared on the platform. However, Instagram is undeniably so far one of the most popular social media in the world and it works also as an influence multiplier machine thanks to its advertisement policy and the followers someone can attract via the platform. Even though cultural content isn’t extensively spread on it, Instagram is a tool that Museums, Galleries and Libraries should develop in order to increase the percentage of their young audience.</p>

                            <p>Making stories, posts and live streaming, the GLAMs can grasp the opportunity to display their collections and special content. Not only the GLAMs but several art enthusiasts love to share art features, photos of museum exhibitions and talk about their experience to their followers.</p>p>

TWITTER

Twitter is a digital platform that can maximise the reach of your Institution to an unlimited number of people, especially youth. Millions of tweets are being produced and spread on a daily basis, covering a broad range of news and stories. This real-time interaction among Twitter users can stimulate the interest of the audience towards your Institution’s activity. Overall, when it comes to the dissemination of collection material, Twitter can be used as a dynamic tool thanks to its #hashtag mechanism that helps you create popular trends, thus preserving users interest and receiving valuable insights from your followers. 

GLAMs maintain a regular presence on Twitter, while it is of great importance to regularly generate new posts and content in order to nurture and keep the interest of their followers alive.

TIK TOK

Since 2017, Tik Tok has won the attention of the public. It's a platform designed to attract all kinds of audiences (youth, elder, tech-savvy etc) but it is definitely widespread among young people. In France, several Cultural Institutions have already developed their own account on Tik Tok. There, they introduce their collections, share their events and news aiming to attract youth’s attention and enhance their participation. By following Cultural Institutions’ accounts, Tik Tok users have the opportunity to learn more about culture and sharpen their critical thinking by confronting different forms of truth - artistic, scientific, philosophical.

                        <h2>1.3. Social media as means of disseminating educational material</h2>
                        <p class="display-7">Social media function as a catalyst for creating opportunities in the field of education, as they encourage the spreading of digital media use and learning initiatives. Considering that new technologies are influencing the way young people learn, play, socialize and participate in civic life, it has become crucial to educate ourselves about social media; thus, acquire knowledge of innovations launched on the internet that can help us communicate with younger audiences.</p>
<p>In particular, several afterschool programs, libraries and museums have already developed digital media practices to support extracurricular learning. There is still though a long way for institutions to go through in order to reach their true potential in forging participatory culture and youth engagement. According to the MacArthur report (2006), which focuses on how youth-serving organisations in the USA have adopted technological practices into their educational programs, institutions should address issues like the unequal access of youth to skills development lessons, the importance of educating youth to recognize the way social media can shape our views and values and the evolution of traditional forms of education and training needed to prepare young people to integrate into new public roles. </p>

<p>Considering that <b>social media</b> are <b>tools</b> to create personalized learning and engagement pathways inside GLAMs and to promote connectivity, we focus now on strategies and opportunities arising from their use. Specifically, we will outline the strategies and approaches for <b>deepening audience engagement with digitally-mediated cultural heritage</b> following the study of Charatzopoulou et al, (2016).</p>

<p>This report examined several strategies by means of case studies, interviews, a survey of the literature and GLAMs’ institutional documentation. Essentially, the research of Charatzopoulou K., Hagedorn-Saupe M., Prehn A., (2016), focuses on the need of cultural institutions to <b>develop a digital strategy</b> that will include a series of actions from the digitization of collections, the use of social media-oriented to enhance audience engagement, the introduction of digital products and services (online shops, e-tickets etc.), to the training of the staff of the institutions so that they can adopt digital practices as part of their everyday action plans. According to the strategies outlined in the Charatzopoulou K., Hagedorn-Saupe M., Prehn A., (2016) report, GLAMs should:</p>
                        <ul><i>
                        <li>embrace a holistic vision, aligned to the institutional mission</li>
                        <li>assess whether an organisation is digitally ready</li>
                        <li>develop a non- digital-centric- ness approach</li>
                        <li>embrace change, renewal and openness as part of the strategic vision</li>
                        <li>infuse a culture of openness in the organisation</li>
                        <li>bring attention to efficient work in multidisciplinary teams</li>
                        <li>capitalise on existing assets and resources and prior digital programmes</li>
                        </i>
                        </ul>
                        <p><b>Social media and social networks</b> serve various entrepreneurs and institutions such as museums, libraries, galleries and archives in their effort to <b>enhance their influence and grow their audience</b> through these technologies.</p>

<p>Following the strategies reported in the research above, we will create a set of actions for GLAMs to learn how to engage with their audience through social media channels to ensure knowledge transferability and better meet the needs of their target groups.</p>

                        <h2>1.4. Social networks for GLAMs during the pandemic</h2>
                        <p class="display-7">In April 2020, when almost all museums around the world were closed due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the International Council of Museums (ICOM) ran a survey on cultural institutions in order to better respond to the emergency and the difficulties arisen in its network (<a href="https://icom.museum/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Report-Museums-and-COVID-19.pdf">ICOM, 2020</a>). According to this survey, 94,7% of the museums that participated in it were closed.</p> 

<p>During the lockdown, many museums reconsidered and revalued their digital activities. Although it was shown that half of the museums that were part of the survey had already a presence on social media, <b>digital communication activities have been augmented in at least 15% of the cases</b>. Cultural institutions used their social networks in order to engage with the audience, by using mainstream digital tools (email, website) and social networking tools. Therefore, social media activities saw an outstanding increase in numbers in more than half of the museums surveyed.</p> 

                        <p>Under the pandemic circumstances, <b>UNESCO</b> also launched a <a href="https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000373530/PDF/373530eng.pdf.multi">study</a> to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 on museums and cultural institutions (UNESCO, 2020).</p>

<p>In this study, Unesco appraised museums’ initiatives around the world. Some of the <b>digital activities</b> developed during museum closures were:</p>
                        <ol>
                        <li>The use of previously digitised resources</li>
                        <li>Digitisation of planned activities during the months of lockdown</li>
                        <li>Increased activity on social media</li>
                        <li>Special activities created for lockdown</li>
                        <li>Professional  and  scientific  activities  organised  in  the  context  of  lockdown</li>
                        </ol>

<p><b>Families</b> and especially <b>young people</b> benefited the most from the situation, as they represent the part of the population that is most active online, interacting through an average number of 4-5 digital platforms (such as Twitter, Facebook, TikTok, and Instagram) on a day-to-day basis.</p>

<p>We will now have a quick look at practices and actions organized remotely by cultural organizations (GLAMs) aiming to ensure interactive and creative activities for everyone during the pandemic.</p>

<p>In this context, <b>Europeana</b>, a distinguished institution that empowers the cultural heritage sector in its digital transformation, showcased  a variety of cultural initiatives during the pandemic. All of them were carried out through digital media channels and especially, social media in order to facilitate access to the institutions’  cultural content and forge youth engagement in their activities.</p>

<p>Museums have primarily based their actions on their existing resources, like <b>online collection portals</b> and <b>social media accounts</b> and focused on creating new content, such as <b>virtual exhibitions</b> and <b>virtual tours</b> of their galleries via streaming platforms or realising <b>digital educational material</b> for children and adults.</p>
